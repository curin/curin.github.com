    The Ioran Games is planned to have three titles in the series:
    <ul>
        <li>Midrion</li>
        <li>Abaranth</li>
        <li>The Chronicle of Draconin Forentum</li>
    </ul>

    Each game builds up a story and new mechanics with each title in the series. Over the course of the past ten year that
    I have worked on this project it has evolved from a single online title which included cobbled together mechanics I
    thought would work well together and make a game more fun to a refined approach top building an experience that I hope
    will last with players for a lifetime.

    <h2>Midrion</h2>
        This title will be the first and will be a two dimensional RPG, most likely isometric in nature. The game
    will introduce players to a new world, Iora, and introduce an important mechanic which will be built on in later
    titles. This mechanic is a magic system which while bears similarities to other systems has its own intricacies.
    This will also provide an opportunity to early on decide what needs to be changed before the system becomes more
    complicated.

    <h2>Abaranth</h2>
        The second title in the series will be a 3D action RPG which will include an updated version of the magic system.
    It will also service as one of the major story plot points for the final game as a catalyst of the events following
    it. The game will also introduce a melee combat which will need to be tuned for the final title again to make it better.

    <h2>the Chronicle of the Draconin Forentum</h2>
         This final installment will be a 3D MMORPG which will be a culmination of the series. This will include the system
    created in the prior games with any necessary improvements. The focus of this game will be to create a living and
    breathing world in an MMO. The game will be designed to have a plot the consistently moves, not just with major updates
    but every moment in between. I would also like to see systems put in place where it can be just as fun to be the merchant
    as it would be a fighter. This will be the most ambitious part of the project and therefore will need to be handled with the
    most care.

    <h2>Current Progress</h2>
        The project is currently waiting on the base engine that will run the games.
