        This is a game engine I am working on as both a learning project and a base for future projects which includes
    <a href="{{ site.url }}/project/Iora">the Ioran Game Series</a>. Over the about five years this project has been in
    development, the project has changed from being built on XNA, then to SlimDX, to SharpDX using DirectX 11, then
    SharpDX using DirectX12, and finally utilizing a custom managed wrapper for DirectX12. The initial three changes
    in the api I used was in order to get a thinner wrapper to better understand DirectX as well with SharpDX having
    better support than SlimDX. The last change to a custom wrapper had to do with two reasons. First of which is a
    difference in approach compared to SharpDX which utilizes P/Invoke which the custom wrapper is a managed C++ wrapper.
    The other reason is to really understand all the available functions of DirectX 12. This is not the only part of the
    engine that has changed since the projects inception. The Design has grown to fit a proper architecture,
    namely the Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture. The project is currently in the early phases as it is currently
    waiting for the completion of the wrapper.

    <h2>Design Pillars</h2>
    As the engine is currently designed, there are four design pillars it was made to uphold.
    <ul>
        <li>Modular</li>
        <li>Multi-threaded</li>
        <li>Multi-window Support</li>
        <li>Layer-based Cameras</li>
    </ul>

        These pillars mostly encompass features for the engine itself, but they impact each part of how systems are to be
    built. The first pillar is modularity and this has to do with the fact that the engine should be adaptable. Ultimately,
    every project may require unique approaches to solving problems. A general solution will never out perform the
    specific solution and an engine needs to support that ability in every system. This is planned to be supported by the
    ECS architecture as it allows for any system to be replaced with a new one or excluded entirely. C#'s interfaces
    will also allow for another layer of modularity. Every decision in the engine will be to support this idea of being
    replacable.
        The second pillar is Multi-threaded or to allow for the system to run on multiple CPU cores. Obviously this has
    benefit of performance boost on most computers and is now commonplace in engines. The utilization of DirectX 12 will
    allow for multi-threaded rendering recording. Beyond this my plan is to streamline the process for multithreading to
    allow for ease of use. This will allow for users of the engine to utilize the multi-thread systems to their advantage
    and create threads for their own uses.
        The Third pillar is multi-window support which is rarely seen in games today where computers with more than one
    monitor is rather common. While this support will have to factor in the availability of multiple monitors for full
    screen mode the different windows. This feature will be more difficult to include on console titles, but the ability
    to make that transition just as smooth will also be a goal should this engine expand to consoles.
        The last pillar is layer-based cameras. The idea behind this is to allow for a scene to be sectioned out into
    layers which can be turned on and off on a camera basis. Each object will have layers set for which they will be
    rendered to. If a camera includes a layer for a particular object it will draw that object. This can be broken down
    beyond and object level to even components of the objects to allow for even more fine tuning. The hope is that this
    will allow for effects that create similar scenes with any where from slight or glaring differences.

    <h2>Current Progress</h2>
    Currently, the project is waiting on the DirectX 12 wrapper to be finished before the rest of the engine gets work
    done. Several prototypes of parts of the system have been developed but none are currently included in the project
    at this time. Once the wrapper comes close to completion, a more concrete design for the engine will be created.
